Čierny hrad [1] is a defunct castle in Slovakia in the Tribeč Mountains, located 13 km north of Zlaté Moravce above the village of Zlatno.
        </p>
        <p>
The history of the castle is not yet known, as the castle did not do any research. It was not until 2005, 2007 and 2009 that the first archaeological excavations were carried out at the castle, which helped us to date more accurately the period of existence of the castle and its dispositions.

The castle was most likely built on a real hill from the early Bronze Age. The find material also documents the settlement of the locality in the 9th and 10th centuries by the Slavs. It was probably a high fortification before the Hungarian invasions. The later, medieval stone castle was built sometime in the late 13th or early 14th century. [2] The construction of the castle deep in the mountains in such remote subpages off important roads was probably related to gold panning in nearby Zlatna. The strategic location of the castle allowed visual contact with the castles Gýmeš and Hrušov, as well as the nearby Velčický castle. Historian Ján Lukačka specifies that the builders of the castle were the ancestors of Báša (Baas), who lived at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. [3]. In 1341, his sons Marek and Ján are mentioned as the owners of Zlatno (Zalathnuk). However, a lot of found material from the 13th century is used instead of a stone castle to assume the existence of an older wood-based castle in the 13th century. Báš's descendants probably died without descendants, because in 1386 King donated Zlatno to Blažej Forgáč. However, he died in the same year and his heirs probably lost Zlatno quickly, as in 1396 he was mentioned as its owner Vavrinec from Veľké Uheriec. Based on the find material, the demise of the castle can be assumed at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries. However, it is possible that the castle was temporarily controlled by the brothers in the middle of the 15th century. [3]
        </p>
        <p>
The only written mention of the castle dates from 1516. In the charter, the Forgacs demand from the king the right to pan for gold on their estate Fekhetewar (Black Castle). [3] Isolated finds from the 16th century suggest that the castle may have been temporarily restored at this time.

Since 2006, in addition to archaeological research, conservation work has been underway on the castle.
